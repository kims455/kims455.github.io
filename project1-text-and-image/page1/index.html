            <p class="overlay-text">The summer of 2018 in Irvine, California, was one of the most precious moments in my life.</p> 
            <p class="overlay-text">It was the year we wrapped up living in California and moved back to Seoul, South Korea, along with the reunion with my dad, who stayed in Korea to work.</p> 
            <p class="overlay-text">I took this photo on my older sister's last day of high school before her graduation.</p>
            <p class="overlay-text">There is a unique tradition of University High School where the seniors get to throw all the papers they've done throughout their high school years into the sky, celebrate the end of their senior year, and cherish the moment.</p>
            <p class="overlay-text">All those papers in the sky reminded me of the peace doves, the photo's title.</p>
            <p class="overlay-text">This photo is one of my favorite memories because it celebrates my sister's graduation and resonates with the end of my first year at University High School in California to return to my home in Seoul, where our family, friends, and memories awaited us.</p>
            <p class="overlay-text">While capturing this moment, I imagined my last day of high school, including the atmosphere, weather, feelings, and new goals.</p>
