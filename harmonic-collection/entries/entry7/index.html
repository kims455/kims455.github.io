        <p class="title">Circle, Circle, Circle ... It's everywhere!</p>
        <p class="describe">I love asking questions to myself frequently whenever I start a new adventure of discovering the answers to the curiosities that pop up in my head daily. This week's question was: "Look around you. How many circles can you find?" Throughout the semester, I used several shapes to create the entries, yet I wanted a new exploration of a single shape, a circle. I then started exploring, finding circles around me and in my photo archives, too. Moreover, I was amazed by how circles can be used in many ways, such as balloons, windows, safety mirrors, bottles, sculptures, maintenance holes, etc. With a busy life, people might not be aware of the shapes of the objects they use, see, walk past, eat, and more.</p>
        <p class="describe">While recording the circles and spheres I saw, I decided to combine the symmetry and asymmetry aspects of the circle. Since a circle has unlimited lines of symmetry, I wanted to utilize that feature and integrate it with what is inside the circular shape, which can be anything and asymmetrical, unlike its symmetrical shape. Furthermore, all the photos above are in perfect circles but have different things inside them. With a stereotypical thought of circles/spheres as a planet, I felt the photos looked like variations of planets inside my imaginative world.</p>
