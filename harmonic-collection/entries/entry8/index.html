        <p class="title">From To-Do Lists to Bright Ideas</p>
        <p class="describe">Since middle school, post-it notes have been the best tool to keep track of the tasks and reminders I need to complete, turning the ordinary into something extraordinary. Those small, colorful squares have helped me become a well-organized and planned person. Nowadays, I often use the apps on my phone to limit the amount of paper waste. From to-do lists to bright ideas, post-it notes were like canvases for my thoughts and brainstorming all the ideas to create works.</p>
        <p class="describe">A single post-it note can contain a lot of ideas. It can be a sketch, handwritten text, painting, printed, and more since there are no rules or limitations on how we use them. During the first stage of developing my ideas for a specific project, I jot down and scribble whatever I have to bring out my imagination to the furthest extent possible. Then, I  spread out the notes to see them as a whole, which helped me to eliminate or add some ideas. Those unexpected and unassumed notes connect my creativity and inspiration for the ideas. During this process, the notes bridge the mundane tasks and the extraordinary of finding the core ideas waiting to be discovered deep down in my world.</p>        
        <p class="describe">Post-it notes are a playground with no restrictions where anyone's ordinary tasks become extraordinary achievements. I keep all the essential post-it notes, like the list of midterms or finals I need to complete on specific dates with each step and schedule, to see how my skills and myself developed throughout the semester. Even though it is just a tiny note, I feel proud of myself when I look through them chronologically, and it motivates me to become even more well-planned and organized. With all the colors and scribbles, those notes spark a sense of wonder and adventure, proving that many extraordinary things get hidden or forgotten easily.</p>

<strong>First, let's organize my thoughts:</strong>
What do I have in my mind?
What should I try this time?
What do I want to do?
What do I have to do?
What do I need?

How should I start?
How long will it take?
How can I create it?
How can I make it better?
How will it look at the end?
