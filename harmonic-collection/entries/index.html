    <h1>Distorted Realities</h1>

    <h3><strong>Welcome to the world of distortion.</strong></h3>
  
    <p>"Distorted Realities" is a journey that seeks to unveil the hidden sides of NYC's identity by capturing distortions around us.</p>
    <p>I will explore the multifaceted and surreal aspects of daily life in NYC.</p>
    <p>I will show a dynamic, unusual, and thought-provoking perspective on urban existence where reality and illusion seamlessly intermingle.</p>
    <p>The journey of Distortion Realities is where I find moments of "distorted reality" in my daily life each week.</p>

    I think some of the questions I posed in the previous entry are still relevant here and I'm curious to see how you'll continue developing content each week. I think honing on specific incidences or details that you find that "never get old for you" can be helpful. I think your collection should be more obvious to a user (a casual user, but one that is interested in spending a reasonable time with your work).

    I think more clarity on that will help amplify some of the visual treatments you're exploring, too
