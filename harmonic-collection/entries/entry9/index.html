            <h2 class="title">Struggle to Snuggle</h2>
            <p class="describe">I don't know how I'm supposed to take all this. I've been running as hard as I can for a long time, and it's never-ending. I've done my best. I can say that confidently because I've always tried to work genuinely hard at everything and never give up, but I'm not satisfied with what I've created. I used to feel so frustrated and pathetic with myself. I was angry and disappointed in myself. It had been going on for half a year now. Except for my family and close friends, there was no support from anyone around me. But then I realized I had to do all this by myself. Living in this hectic and dreary city of New York, I feel like it's sucking all my hopeful and bright energy out of me. From the moment I arrived in New York City each semester, the desire to return home to live with my family (including our dog, Harry) has been getting more desperate, as well as the determination to graduate from Parsons School of Design no matter what. Not everything will turn out how I want it to, but it's a process of growing up and becoming more mature and professional.</p>
            <p class="describe">I'm exhausted. I was so clear in the beginning about what I wanted to learn and what I wanted to do, but the further I went, the more confused I got. Yes, the reality is often disappointing, but my parents are so supportive and encouraging, and I'm trying to do my best to learn everything I can and not be afraid to try new things. I'm going to keep my head up, accept it all, shake it off, and I'm going to make sure I achieve the goals I want to achieve and live the life I want to live. After all the whining, complaining, and struggling, I always say or write this sentence without overthinking: "But what the heck, I'm going to do it." And just like that, I made it through another day. Can I look forward to tomorrow? I'm worried about it, but I'm just going to stop thinking about it and rest a little bit. Now, please get some rest. You deserve it. You know how much you pour into everything. Accept the reality and live your life because you only live once. And continue to find the extraordinary in the ordinary to make your life more optimistic and lighthearted. This week's "extraordinary" was the phases of emotional transition. These emotions sometimes get lost in the busyness of life. I study about myself even today because I need to notice it, identify the problem, and make myself stronger.</p>
            <p class="describe">I hope that one day, people will recognize how hard I tried, how much I struggled, and how I never gave up because that is all I need to continue my journey. Even if it's just a small compliment from others, it makes me delighted.</p>
