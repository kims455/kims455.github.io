        A manhole is a covered opening or access point on the surface of a road, sidewalk, or other paved area that provides entry into an underground utility or infrastructure system.
    </p>

    <p class="bottom-text">
        Manholes are common in urban areas and serve as access points to underground networks, including sewer systems, storm water drains, electrical and communication cables, water pipelines, and gas lines. They allow workers to enter these underground structures for repairs, cleaning, inspections, or installations.
